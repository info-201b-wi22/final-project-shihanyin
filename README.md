# Introduction



# Conclusion
## Takeaways
The three major takeaways are about **covid cases, the crime number, and crime types**.

The trend of the number of covid cases in each county in Washington State has been shown in the first plot. It can be clearly seen that covid-19 has been in Washington state since around February 2020, and there has been a linear increase in cases since then. By January next year, there has been an exponential increase in cases. It can be inferred that the delta variant, which is more infectious, started entering Washington state and became a major contributor to covid cases. The rate of increase slowed down in early February because more and more people are vaccinated and good anti-epidemic measures by local government. Among all the counties, King County has the highest number of covid cases due to its high county population.

Our analysis has divided crime types into three categories: personal crime, property crime and social crime. It can be clearly seen from the comparison of the number of crime incidents from 2019-2020 that property crime (+51005) in Washington State. The personal crime has decreased (-2732), as well as social crime (-5783). However, the results of overall crime number trend have been surprising. As the county with both the highest number of covid-19 cases and highest number of crime cases, King County is the subject that we intend to take a closer look at. By comparing the number of crimes from 2018, 2019 and 2020, the trends show that changes in crime rates seem to be random and irregular. However, it is worth noting that the crime figures for 2020 are basically smaller than the figures for last tow years. The highest monthly crime number is 670 in October 2019, while the lowest one is 342 in June 2020.

## Insights
-	Generally speaking, there is a light positive correlation between covid cases and crime numbers, if only consider a county's covid cases and crime number. However, when taking a closer look at the situation of a county, the crime number seems to show a negative correlation with covid cases.
-	During the pandemic, work/study-from-home policy has forced many residents to stay at home, thereby reducing overall crime. However, the epidemic has also forced many stores to close and some people probably lose their jobs or even live on the streets, which may explain the increased distribution of property crime in Washington state.
-	The correlation between crime and covid is very light and many other factors can exist to influence these two variables. Further exploration is still needed.

## Implications
The seriousness of the pandemic can be served as the degree to measure the effectiveness of the public health system. By looking at our graphs in covid cases distribution, administrators in public health system can have a more general idea of the condition about the covid spread as well as the security measures. Also, crime rates could be served as a standard to test the management of government. We are expecting to find a result of a clear correlation between crime rates and covid cases. To be more specific, we are expecting to find a positive relationship between crime rates and covid cases, which means covid facilities the crimes. In this way, in order to decrease crime rate in a region, policymakers can start with controlling the spread of covid. They can control the crime rate as well as the spread of covid, and maybe cooperate with the public health system.
